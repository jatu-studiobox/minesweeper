# Minesweeper Web Game
This is my practice for build a simplified game of web page game Minesweeper using vanilla JavaScript.

I follow the teaching of Ania Kubow (see references)

## Additional challenges and fixed some bugs
* Fixed display bomb count at the corner area.
* Add remain marked flag at above playing area.
* Add clock for display challenge time at above playing area.
* Add double click function at each checked bomb number squares for auto open nearby.
